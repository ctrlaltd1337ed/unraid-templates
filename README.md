# Unraid Templates

This repository contains Unraid templates that I've put together for the community. These templates make it easier to deploy various Docker containers on Unraid.

Feel free to use, modify, and contribute!

## Usage (Community Applications)
Search for the container name in Community Applications, and install as normal.

## Contributing
* If you have improvements or bug fixes for my templates, feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue.
* If your issue is with the application itself, please reach out to the developer.

## Unraid Forum Support
* If you have any issues, and prefer to post on the Unraid forum, [this is my thread](https://forums.unraid.net/topic/188012-support-ctrlaltd1337s-unraid-templates/).
